Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Principle Explanation
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented programming. It states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or job. This principle aims to achieve a high level of cohesion within classes and avoid the negative impacts of coupling, making the codebase more maintainable, testable, and understandable.

By ensuring that each class has a single responsibility, the system becomes easier to manage, and changes in one part of the system do not have unintended consequences in other parts.

Defective Version Explanation
In the defective version of our implementation, the UserService class violates the Single Responsibility Principle. Hereâ€™s why:

Multiple Responsibilities: The UserService class is responsible for multiple tasks, including validating user data, saving the user to the database, and sending emails. This makes the class difficult to maintain and prone to errors.

Difficult to Extend: If we need to modify the way validation is performed or how emails are sent, we would need to modify the UserService class, increasing the risk of introducing bugs.

Refactored Version Explanation
In the refactored version, the responsibilities are separated into different classes, each with a single responsibility. This design adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle and results in a codebase that is easier to maintain and extend.

Key Improvements:
Separation of Concerns: The responsibilities of validating user data, saving users to the database, and sending emails are now handled by separate classes (UserValidatorService, UserRepository, and EmailService).

SRP Compliance: Each class now has a single reason to change, making the code more maintainable and reducing the risk of introducing bugs.
