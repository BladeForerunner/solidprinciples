Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Principle Explanation
The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented programming. It states that software entities (such as classes, modules, and functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that the behavior of a module should be extendable without modifying its source code. The OCP helps in creating a codebase that is flexible, maintainable, and scalable.

In essence, when a new feature or requirement needs to be added, you should be able to extend the existing code by adding new code rather than modifying existing code. This reduces the risk of introducing bugs into a stable codebase.

Defective Version Explanation
In the defective version of our implementation, the PaymentService class violates the Open/Closed Principle. Hereâ€™s why:

Improper Inheritance: The DebitCardPaymentProcessor class inherits from CreditCardPaymentProcessor and directly calls the processCreditCardPayment method. This is inappropriate because it couples the debit card processing logic with the credit card processing logic, which should be separate.

Violation of OCP: The PaymentService class requires modification whenever a new payment type (e.g., PayPal) is added. This violates the Open/Closed Principle because the class is not closed for modification.

Refactored Version Explanation
In the refactored version, we ensure that the PaymentService class adheres to the Open/Closed Principle by using a map of PaymentProcessor implementations. This design allows the system to be extended with new payment types without modifying the existing code.

Key Improvements:

Separation of Responsibilities: The DebitCardPaymentProcessor and CreditCardPaymentProcessor are no longer coupled. Each class implements the PaymentProcessor interface, ensuring that their behavior is independent.

OCP Compliance: The PaymentService class no longer needs to be modified when new payment types are introduced. Instead, new payment processors can be added by simply creating new classes that implement PaymentProcessor.
